# AoeCombatSimulator (deprecated)
A (non-visual) combat simulator for Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition

This is the (deprecated) C# .NET Forms version of my AoE2-DE combat simulator.
For the newest version, have a look at the web version (client-side simulation using Angular 9 (Typescript)).
You can find the current version here https://github.com/Zukatah/AoeCombatSimulatorWeb and the hosted version here https://aoe-combatsim.com/ .
